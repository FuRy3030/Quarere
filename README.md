# Quarere

Most of the people studying English do it, at least in some part, through reading while some of them treat reading as a primary source of the learning process. Moreover, nearly everyone opens Google and goes through popular articles that seem interesting. Quarere is the first version of a tool serving as a perfect addition when it comes to learning English this way. The process of how the application works is very simple.

All the user needs is a custom, chosen piece of text. It could be anything: a short story from British Council, a technology-related article, or a chapter from a favorite book. Then the user can read the whole text in a comfortable interface that provides him with meanings, synonyms, antonyms, translations, examples, phonetics, and origins of the hovered words or phrases. After getting to the end of the story, all unknown words and phrases for the user can be transformed into learning materials forming a set, which allows for unlimited modification, including editing, adding, or deleting elements inside it. Finally, the user is able to revise new things by utilizing one of the learning modes, for instance, flashcards.

On top of that, the application lets the learner use the embedded, significantly more detailed dictionary that contains even more meanings, translations, examples, and synonyms with plenty of sub-meanings accompanying them. In addition, it allows for the creation of the aforementioned learning materials directly from its elements. In other words, the user can choose which meanings, examples, synonyms, or translations he wants to use by simply clicking them.
